git pull is one of many commands that claim the responsibility of 'syncing' remote content. The git remote command is used to specify what remote endpoints the syncing commands will operate on. The git push command is used to upload content to a remote repository.

The git fetch command can be confused with git pull. They are both used to download remote content. An important safety distinction can be made between git pull and get fetch. git fetch can be considered the "safe" option whereas, git pull can be considered unsafe. git fetch will download the remote content and not alter the state of the local repository. Alternatively, git pull will download remote content and immediately attempt to change the local state to match that content. This may unintentionally cause the local repository to get in a conflicted state.
